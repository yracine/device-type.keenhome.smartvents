**************************************************************************************************

PREREQUISITES
=====================


- Your Keen Home vent(s) fully operational (not connected to the Keen Home Hub, but to the ST hub)
- Developer access to SmartThings (http://graph.api.smartthings.com/)
- <b> Determine your shard, please consult this thread:</b>

https://community.smartthings.com/t/faq-how-to-find-out-what-shard-cloud-slice-ide-url-your-account-location-is-on/53923

Or the SmartThings documentation here for more details:

http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/publishing/index.html#ensure-proper-location

<b>If you are on the different shard, you need to change the links below for your right shard. </b>

As an example, in the North America,

replace https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/devices by https://graph-na02-useast1.api.smartthings.com



The device type's configure tile changes the pressure and temp's refresh rate to be 5-10 minutes instead of 1 minute (set by default) in order to avoid excessive battery usage.

Setup time: about 2-5 minutes depending on your ST skills

INSTALLATION STEPS
=====================


# 1) Create the device type (Keen Home Smart Vent)

a) Go to https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/devices    (or whatever your shard is and click on My Device Handlers in the IDE's top menu)

b) Hit the "+New Device Type" at the top right corner

c) Hit the "From Code" tab on the left corner

d) Copy and paste the code from 

https://github.com/yracine/keenhome.device-type/blob/master/devicetypes/keensmartvent.src/keensmartvent.groovy

e) Hit the create button at the bottom

f) Hit the "publish/for me" button at the top right corner (in the code window)


# 2) Assign your devices to the new device type (should be at the end of your device list)

a) Go to https://graph.api.smartthings.com/device/list    (or whatever your shard is and click on My Devices in the IDE's top menu)

b) Click on your device(s), and then edit at the bottom

c) Choose the new device type (v1.0.1) from the list using the type field

d) Hit the save button at the bottom


# 3) Configure the new device settings in the smartThing classic app</b>


a) Go to the Home tab, click on Things, and the right device

b) Hit the configure tile to set the new 'refresh rate' settings.

You need to press the configure tile for each device that you have.

Hitting the configure button will no do anything in the UI, but it will change the polling rate (5-10 minutes instead of 1 minute polling) in the list of events.
